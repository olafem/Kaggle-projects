However, this rapid expansion has brought to light a concerning issue known as \"THC inflation.\" THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the primary psychoactive compound found in cannabis, and its potency plays a crucial role in product quality and consumer safety.\n\nTHC inflation refers to the phenomenon where the reported THC content in cannabis products, particularly distillates, significantly exceeds the actual levels. This discrepancy has raised concerns among both the public and Licensed Producers (LPs), prompting efforts to address this pressing issue. Inflated THC levels can mislead consumers, compromise their experiences, and impact their overall perception of cannabis products. Additionally, it can undermine regulatory compliance and consumer trust in the industry.\n\nEfforts to mitigate THC inflation involve a multifaceted approach, encompassing collaboration between LPs, consumers, and regulatory bodies. Among the various strategies proposed, a promising avenue is the use of advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning models to predict THC content accurately. Such models leverage data from potency testing, offering an alternative means of verification while reducing reliance on reported THC values.\n\nThis project focuses on one such innovative approach, aiming to use Cannabinol (CBN) values to predict THC levels in cannabis distillates with an impressive 92% accuracy rate. The dataset employed for this project comprises in-house potency results for approximately 500 distillate samples, meticulously generated by BZAM Management Inc.. This extensive dataset is instrumental in developing a robust predictive model.\n\nThe project commenced with a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, revealing a significant negative correlation (-0.83) between CBN and delta-9-THC (d9-THC) for distillates. This correlation suggests that as CBN levels rise, d9-THC levels tend to decrease, reflecting the natural degradation of THC over time due to exposure to high temperature, oxygen and light. Understanding this relationship is pivotal in the development of an accurate predictive model.\n\nTo build the predictive model, the dataset was divided into training and test sets, with 70% used for training and 30% for testing. The model was optimized using polynomial features, ensuring it captures the complex interplay between CBN and THC content in cannabis distillates.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing the issue of THC inflation in the cannabis industry is of paramount importance for the integrity and sustainability of the market. This project represents a significant step in the right direction by harnessing the power of machine learning to predict THC values accurately using CBN data, offering a potential solution to mitigate THC inflation and enhance transparency in the industry. The subsequent sections of this paper delve into the methodology, results, and implications of this groundbreaking approach, shedding light on its potential to reshape the cannabis testing landscape.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Dataset from BZAM Management Inc.

Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, this project represents a significant stride toward addressing the issue of THC inflation within the cannabis industry. The developed predictive model, which accurately predicts THC values in cannabis distillates with impressive precision well within the margin of error, stands as a potent tool for bolstering transparency and reliability. Its ability to pinpoint instances where THC values deviate from expected norms not only safeguards against inflated THC data but also serves as a crucial quality assurance mechanism for testing laboratories. This multifaceted approach not only ensures consumer trust and satisfaction but also contributes to the broader goal of advancing industry standards and best practices. By enhancing the accuracy of reported THC values and providing checks and balances for quality assurance, this model heralds a promising future for the cannabis testing landscape.<br>\n\nAs the cannabis industry continues to evolve, the importance of accurate potency testing cannot be overstated. This project not only provides a solution to the problem of inflated THC values but also empowers industry stakeholders, including producers, consumers, and regulatory bodies, to make informed decisions based on reliable data. With its robust performance and capacity to uphold quality standards, the model not only stands as a testament to innovation but also as a vital tool for fostering trust, accountability, and the continued growth of the cannabis sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.to_csv('potency_processed.csv')\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-03T19:41:45.423433Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-03T19:41:45.424919Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-03T19:41:45.467973Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-03T19:41:45.424853Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-03T19:41:45.466608Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
